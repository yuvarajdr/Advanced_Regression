## General Information
- Creating Machine Learning model by using Ridge and Lasso(Advance Regression).
- A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market.
- The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price.
- For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Ridge Model with optimum alpha value 100 R2 Score (variance on test data) is 85.9% and RMSE (prediction made by model off by RMSE units) of test data is 0.1486.
- Lasso Model with optimum alpha value 0.001 R2 Score (variance on test data) is 86.1% and RMSE (prediction made by model off by RMSE units) of test data is 0.1472.
